## fbcalc
A simple scientific calculator that works on any monochrome framebuffer (1bpp).

It's designed to be used on microcontrollers with lcd/oled monochrome screens of any size.

This library only requires an allocator, a way to get input from the user and a way to display the framebuffer.

The framebuffer is defined as a 2-dimensional vector
